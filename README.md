# Baseball: The Drinking Game

---

## Description:
This very simple app was created out of frustration. There is a drinking game called Baseball which becomes difficult to keep track of the game the more you drink...naturally. This app aims to help aid the game experience so you can continue on with a night of senselessness.

Note: This was tossed together really fast….to the point where it doesn’t even use a database. I do plan to drastically overhaul the code and maybe try building this out in Node.js. It’s currently built in Rails (which is overkill for an app like this).

## Implementation:
This app was originally tossed together in a few hours using Ruby on Rails. Obviously that was not the best decision, but it was the best I could do with the weekend fast approaching. I had plans to re-build it using Node.js, but I started playing around with Vue.js and thought this app was simple enough to use as a "learner-app". You can check out the cleaner Vue.js version of this app [here](https://github.com/mikeymurph77/vue-baseball)
